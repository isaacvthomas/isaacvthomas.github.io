    "text": "Boise State is still performing well in total rushing yards, as they are currently third in the Mountain West Conference with 1664 rushing yards. These stats are 9 games in, so they don’t include this past weekend’s Boise State game. All of my stats came from CFB Stats.\nWhat makes this bar chart interesting? Boise State is 36th in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in total rushing yards so far this year. So they are doing just fine. Not to mention that it’s better than Nebraska. Do they have a better running back than Nebraska? No. Individual stats will tell you that. Are they a better team than Nebraska? No. Nebraska would win that match-up by at least two scores. Just watching college football will tell you that. Still, Boise State’s rushing offense is interesting and has been for years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nrushing25 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing25.csv\")\n\nmountainwestconference &lt;- rushing25 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Air Force\" |\n    Name == \"Boise State\" |\n    Name == \"Colorado State\" |\n    Name == \"Fresno State\" |\n    Name == \"Hawaii\" |\n    Name == \"Nevada\" |\n    Name == \"New Mexico\" |\n    Name == \"San Diego State\" |\n    Name == \"San Jose State\" |\n    Name == \"Utah State\" |\n    Name == \"Wyoming\" |\n    Name == \"UNLV\"\n  )\n\nboisest &lt;- mountainwestconference |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Boise State\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = mountainwestconference,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = boisest,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"So far this year Boise State is third in the\\nMountain West Conference in total rushing\\nyards\",\n    subtitle = \"Boise State's Total Rushing Yards in 2025\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Rushing Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFB Stats\\nBy: Isaac Thomas\" \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(20, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5), \"pt\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Boise State finished ranked 8th in FBS in total rushing yards. This means they performed better than about 94% of teams when it comes to total rushing yards. These are team total rushing yards stats, but Ashton Jeanty, 2024 Heisman finalist runner-up, has a lot to do with these stats. He definitely had a major impact. I mean, he was first in FBS in total rushing yards with 2601. Others added to this, but he is the bulk of it.\nBack to the point of this graph. In 2024, Boise State finished ranked 2nd in the Mountain West Conference in total rushing yards. Only a step better than this year so far, but that does not tell the whole story. Overall, in college football, rushing was better in 2024 than it is this year. This year’s Boise State probably won’t come close to their total rushing yards in 2024, which was 3365 total rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\nrushing24 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing24.csv\") \n\nmountainwestconference &lt;- rushing24 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Air Force\" |\n    Name == \"Boise State\" |\n    Name == \"Colorado State\" |\n    Name == \"Fresno State\" |\n    Name == \"Hawaii\" |\n    Name == \"Nevada\" |\n    Name == \"New Mexico\" |\n    Name == \"San Diego State\" |\n    Name == \"San Jose State\" |\n    Name == \"Utah State\" |\n    Name == \"Wyoming\" |\n    Name == \"UNLV\"\n  )\n\nboisest &lt;- mountainwestconference |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Boise State\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = mountainwestconference,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = boisest,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boise State's was second in Total Rushing \\nYards\\nCompared to the\\nMountain West Conference in 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"Boise State's 2024 Total Rushing Yards\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Rushing Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFB Stats\\nBy: Isaac Thomas\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(20, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5), \"pt\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoise State established a dominant ground game throughout the 2023 season, accumulating 3,008 total rushing yards. This strong performance placed them among the nation’s elite, ranking 8th overall in the FBS for total rushing yards. Within their own league, the Mountain West Conference, the team’s production was second only to Air Force’s triple-option attack, cementing Boise State’s standing as the second-ranked rushing offense in the conference.

This performance was strong enough to secure the second spot in the Mountain West Conference rushing rankings, continuing the program’s tradition of dominance on the ground. Nationally, this total placed them reliably within the top third of the country, finishing the season 30th overall in the FBS for total team rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\nrushing22 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing22.csv\")\n\nmountainwestconference &lt;- rushing22 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Air Force\" |\n    Name == \"Boise State\" |\n    Name == \"Colorado State\" |\n    Name == \"Fresno State\" |\n    Name == \"Hawaii\" |\n    Name == \"Nevada\" |\n    Name == \"New Mexico\" |\n    Name == \"San Diego State\" |\n    Name == \"San Jose State\" |\n    Name == \"Utah State\" |\n    Name == \"Wyoming\" |\n    Name == \"UNLV\"\n  )\n\nboisest &lt;- mountainwestconference |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Boise State\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = mountainwestconference,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = boisest,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boise State was second in the Mountain West\\nConference in Total Rushing Yards\",\n    subtitle = \"Boise State's 2022 Total Rushing Yards\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Rushing Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFB Stats\\nBy: Isaac Thomas\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(20, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5), \"pt\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line chart tracks Boise State’s Rushing Yards Per Game (Yard/G) over the four seasons (2022–2025), isolating their performance (highlighted in blue) against the backdrop of all other NCAA teams (shown in gray). The data clearly indicates that Boise State’s rushing efficiency peaked in 2024, which marked the highest average with 240.36 yards per game. This represented a significant increase from the 2023 average of 214.86 yards per game and the 2022 average of 196.36 yards per game. The trend line shows a notable drop-off in the 2025 season, where the team averaged 184.89 yards per game. This comparison illustrates the dramatic rise and subsequent fall in the team’s season-by-season rushing output relative to the rest of college football.\n\n\nCode\nrushing22 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing22.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nrushing23 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing23.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023)\n\nrushing24 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing24.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2024)\n\nrushing25 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing25.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2025)\n\nrushing_combined &lt;- bind_rows(rushing22, rushing23, rushing24, rushing25)\n\nboisest &lt;- rushing_combined |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Boise State\")\n\n\nggplot(data = rushing_combined, aes(x = Season, y = `Yards/G`, group = Name)) + \n  \n  geom_line(color = \"lightgrey\", alpha = 0.5, linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightgrey\", alpha = 0.5, size = 1.5) + \n  \n  geom_line(data = boisest, \n            color = \"blue\", \n            linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(data = boisest, \n             color = \"blue\", \n             size = 2.5) +\n  \n  \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)) +\n  \n \n  labs(\n    title = \"Boise State Rushing Yards Per Game trended\\nupwards until this year vs. All NCAA Teams (2022-2025)\", \n    subtitle = \"Rushing Yards Per Game (Yards/G) over four seasons.\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Rushing Yards Per Game (Yards/G)\", \n    caption = \"Source: CFB Stats\\nBy: Isaac Thomas\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8, face = \"italic\"),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(15, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5), \"pt\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoise State’s 2024 season stood out as the most dominant period in this four-year analysis, driven by elite rushing efficiency. The team achieved an impressive record of 12 wins and 2 losses, one of those losses being at the beginning of the season to Oregon by 3 points and their second loss being to Penn Sate in the college football playoff. This translated to an 85.7% win rate. This success coincided with a peak performance in the ground game, where the team averaged 6.06 yards per rush during the 2024 season. The scatterplot below visualizes this relationship, comparing the team’s average yards per rush to their seasonal win rate from 2022 to 2025, with the standout 2024 data point highlighted in blue in this scatter plot.\nSo far this season Boise State is 6-3 with an average of 4.75 yard per rush.

Each chart visualizes the proportion of points a team scored compared to the points they allowed, giving a quick sense of their dominance on the court. The 2012 Kentucky Wildcats stand out for their balanced yet high-powered offense, while 2010 Duke and 2013 Louisville show strong scoring capabilities as well. 2011 UConn demonstrates a more even distribution between points scored and allowed.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nget_off_def &lt;- function(df) {\n  pts_col &lt;- names(df)[grepl(\"^PTS\", names(df))]\n  \n  team_val &lt;- df |&gt;\n    filter(...1 == \"Team\") |&gt;\n    pull(all_of(pts_col)) |&gt;\n    as.numeric()\n  \n  opp_val &lt;- df |&gt;\n    filter(...1 == \"Opponent\") |&gt;\n    pull(all_of(pts_col)) |&gt;\n    as.numeric()\n  \n  tibble(Offense = team_val, Defense = opp_val)\n}\n\nmake_waffle_vec &lt;- function(df_row, squares = 100) {\n  df_row |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      total = Offense + Defense,\n      Offense = round(Offense / total * squares),\n      Defense = round(Defense / total * squares)\n    ) |&gt;\n    select(Offense, Defense) |&gt;\n    as.numeric() |&gt;\n    set_names(c(\"Offense\", \"Defense\"))\n}\n\nkentucky_vec &lt;- get_off_def(twentytwelveKentuckyone) |&gt; make_waffle_vec()\nduke_vec &lt;- get_off_def(twentytenDuke) |&gt; make_waffle_vec()\nuconn_vec &lt;- get_off_def(twentyelevenUconnone) |&gt; make_waffle_vec()\nlouisville_vec &lt;- get_off_def(twentythirteenLouisvilleone) |&gt; make_waffle_vec()\n\nkentucky_chart &lt;- waffle(kentucky_vec, rows = 10, colors = c(\"blue\", \"gold\"), title = \"2012 Kentucky\")\nduke_chart &lt;- waffle(duke_vec, rows = 10, colors = c(\"navy\", \"orange\"), title = \"2010 Duke\")\nuconn_chart &lt;- waffle(uconn_vec, rows = 10, colors = c(\"darkblue\", \"gray\"), title = \"2011 UConn\")\nlouisville_chart &lt;- waffle(louisville_vec, rows = 10, colors = c(\"red\", \"black\"), title = \"2013 Louisville\")\n\nfinal_plot &lt;- (kentucky_chart | duke_chart) /\n              (uconn_chart | louisville_chart) +\n              plot_annotation(\n                title = \"Showcasing NCAA Champions’ Offense and Defense Since 2010\",\n                subtitle = \"The share of points scored versus points allowed.\\n2013 Louisville, 2012 Kentucky, and 2010 Duke stand out.\",\n                caption = \"Source: College Basketball Sports Reference | By Isaac Thomas\"\n              )\n\nprint(final_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2012 Kentucky Wildcats stand out as the top scoring team among recent NCAA champions, posting a z-score of about 1.08 for points scored, meaning they scored more than one standard deviation above the average of champions from 2010 to 2014.

Across the visualizations of offense versus defense, total points, and z-scored performance, Kentucky consistently ranks near the top, especially in scoring and free throw attempts. Yet, they do not lead every statistical category, showing that even a standout team has areas where others excel. Taken together with the eye test—watching their pace, depth (many future nba players on team including Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist), and scoring efficiency—the 2012 Wildcats could be considered one of the best national championship teams of the last decade, even if they only dominate in select stats."
