    "text": "Boise State is still performing well in total rushing yards, as they are currently third in the Mountain West Conference with 1664 rushing yards. These stats are 9 games in, so they don’t include this past weekend’s Boise State game. All of my stats came from CFB Stats.\nWhat makes this bar chart interesting? Boise State is 36th in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in total rushing yards so far this year. So they are doing just fine. Not to mention that it’s better than Nebraska. Do they have a better running back than Nebraska? No. Individual stats will tell you that. Are they a better team than Nebraska? No. Nebraska would win that match-up by at least two scores. Just watching college football will tell you that. Still, Boise State’s rushing offense is interesting and has been for years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nrushing25 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing25.csv\")\n\nmountainwestconference &lt;- rushing25 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Air Force\" |\n    Name == \"Boise State\" |\n    Name == \"Colorado State\" |\n    Name == \"Fresno State\" |\n    Name == \"Hawaii\" |\n    Name == \"Nevada\" |\n    Name == \"New Mexico\" |\n    Name == \"San Diego State\" |\n    Name == \"San Jose State\" |\n    Name == \"Utah State\" |\n    Name == \"Wyoming\" |\n    Name == \"UNLV\"\n  )\n\nboisest &lt;- mountainwestconference |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Boise State\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = mountainwestconference,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = boisest,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"So far this year Boise State is third in the\\nMountain West Conference in total rushing\\nyards\",\n    subtitle = \"Boise State's Total Rushing Yards in 2025\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Rushing Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFB Stats\\nBy: Isaac Thomas\" \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(20, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5), \"pt\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Boise State finished ranked 8th in FBS in total rushing yards. This means they performed better than about 94% of teams when it comes to total rushing yards. These are team total rushing yards stats, but Ashton Jeanty, 2024 Heisman finalist runner-up, has a lot to do with these stats. He definitely had a major impact. I mean, he was first in FBS in total rushing yards with 2601. Others added to this, but he is the bulk of it.\nBack to the point of this graph. In 2024, Boise State finished ranked 2nd in the Mountain West Conference in total rushing yards. Only a step better than this year so far, but that does not tell the whole story. Overall, in college football, rushing was better in 2024 than it is this year. This year’s Boise State probably won’t come close to their total rushing yards in 2024, which was 3365 total rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\nrushing24 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing24.csv\") \n\n\nRows: 134 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Name\ndbl (7): G, Att, Yards, Avg, TD, Att/G, Yards/G\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nmountainwestconference &lt;- rushing24 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Air Force\" |\n    Name == \"Boise State\" |\n    Name == \"Colorado State\" |\n    Name == \"Fresno State\" |\n    Name == \"Hawaii\" |\n    Name == \"Nevada\" |\n    Name == \"New Mexico\" |\n    Name == \"San Diego State\" |\n    Name == \"San Jose State\" |\n    Name == \"Utah State\" |\n    Name == \"Wyoming\" |\n    Name == \"UNLV\"\n  )\n\nboisest &lt;- mountainwestconference |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Name == \"Boise State\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = mountainwestconference,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = boisest,\n           aes(x = reorder(Name, Yards), weight = Yards), fill = \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boise State's was second in Total Rushing Yards\\nCompared to the\\nMountain West Conference in 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"Boise State's 2024 Total Rushing Yards\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Rushing Yards\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFB Stats\\nBy: Isaac Thomas\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(20, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5), \"pt\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoise State established a dominant ground game throughout the 2023 season, accumulating 3,008 total rushing yards.

The data clearly indicates that Boise State’s rushing efficiency peaked in 2024, which marked the highest average with 240.36 yards per game. This represented a significant increase from the 2023 average of 214.86 yards per game and the 2022 average of 196.36 yards per game. The trend line shows a notable drop-off in the 2025 season, where the team averaged 184.89 yards per game. This comparison illustrates the dramatic rise and subsequent fall in the team’s season-by-season rushing output relative to the rest of college football.\n\n\nCode\nrushing22 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing22.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2022)\n\n\nRows: 131 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Name\ndbl (7): G, Att, Yards, Avg, TD, Att/G, Yards/G\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nrushing23 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing23.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023)\n\n\nRows: 133 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Name\ndbl (7): G, Att, Yards, Avg, TD, Att/G, Yards/G\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nrushing24 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing24.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2024)\n\n\nRows: 134 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Name\ndbl (7): G, Att, Yards, Avg, TD, Att/G, Yards/G\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nrushing25 &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing25.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2025)\n\n\nRows: 136 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): Name\ndbl (7): G, Att, Yards, Avg, TD, Att/G, Yards/G\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nrushing_combined &lt;- bind_rows(rushing22, rushing23, rushing24, rushing25)\n\nboisest &lt;- rushing_combined |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Boise State\")\n\n\nggplot(data = rushing_combined, aes(x = Season, y = `Yards/G`, group = Name)) + \n  \n  geom_line(color = \"lightgrey\", alpha = 0.5, linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(color = \"lightgrey\", alpha = 0.5, size = 1.5) + \n  \n  geom_line(data = boisest, \n            color = \"blue\", \n            linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(data = boisest, \n             color = \"blue\", \n             size = 2.5) +\n  \n  \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2022, 2023, 2024, 2025)) +\n  \n \n  labs(\n    title = \"Boise State Rushing Yards Per Game trended\\nupwards until this year vs. All NCAA Teams (2022-2025)\", \n    subtitle = \"Rushing Yards Per Game (Yards/G) over four seasons.\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Rushing Yards Per Game (Yards/G)\", \n    caption = \"Source: CFB Stats\\nBy: Isaac Thomas\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8, face = \"italic\"),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(15, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5), \"pt\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoise State’s 2024 season stood out as the most dominant period in this four-year analysis, driven by elite rushing efficiency. The team achieved an impressive record of 12 wins and 2 losses, one of those losses being at the beginning of the season to Oregon by 3 points and their second loss being to Penn Sate in the college football playoff. This translated to an 85.7% win rate. This success coincided with a peak performance in the ground game, where the team averaged 6.06 yards per rush during the 2024 season. The scatterplot below visualizes this relationship, comparing the team’s average yards per rush to their seasonal win rate from 2022 to 2025, with the standout 2024 data point highlighted in blue in this scatter plot.\nSo far this season Boise State is 6-3 with an average of 4.75 yard per rush.
